MINOR TASKS TO DO FOR SITE FURNISHING
!!! <-- indeed a MAJOR TASKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. The refresh thing
	- no post data pop up should be shown when refreshing therefore post data should be cleared
4. !!! change naming convention - !!!
6. Open printable page for reports
	

::: NAMING CONVENTION ::: <--- lot of things to do!!!
function_variable <--- variables to forms
	e.g.
		edit_categoryId
		del_expensesCode
		
if form name - start with small letters ::: edit_CategoryCode
if variable name - starts with big letters ::: $Edit_CategoryCode
if database field name - with underscores ::: category_code



========================
::: BUG FIXING ::::

[DONE][1/23/2014] In expenses.php - when an expense is editted, amount is being validated incorrectly (exceeds the available. not considering itself)
[DONE][1/23/2014] When moving to next cycle, money on hand/bank is being moved to next cycle even the amount is zero(0).
[DONE][1/23/2014] cycle.php - if remaining money (on hand or on bank) is 0, form for transfer should be disabled.
[DONE][1/29/2014] expenses.php - system should validate if entered date is already past the current cycle date
[DONE][1/29/2014] money.php - system should validate negative amount values

[DONE][1/22/2014] Either modify the datatype of the amounts or work on fixing the amounts when editted (99.99999; lots of decimals)
		SOLUTION:
		ALTER TABLE cycle modify starting_money DECIMAL(10,2);
		ALTER TABLE expenses modify amount DECIMAL(10,2);
		ALTER TABLE money modify amount DECIMAL(10,2);
		ALTER TABLE savings modify amount DECIMAL(10,2);
		ALTER TABLE withdraw modify amount DECIMAL(10,2);
		ALTER TABLE withdraw modify service_charge DECIMAL(10,2);	
[DONE][1/22/2014] GENERAL - when updating static data, system allows the same code name after update - this must be validated as well
	- category
	- resource
[DONE][1/22/2014] withdraw.php - if nothing left on the bank, don't show the form
[DONE][1/22/2014] withdraw.php - 'Current cash on hand' computation is wrong
Add Cycle Money - List must be sorted by date
Add Cycle Money - Date later than the cycle date must be validated correctly

::: ENHANCEMENTS :: 
- reports.php - When clicked a category expense, user will be directed to expenses.php 
			wherein the expenses with that category is HIGHLIGHTED
- Static data (category/resource) when adding/updating duplicate code name, highlight the row of the table that duplicates the user input
- Static data (category/resource) when adding/updating duplicate code name, highlight the row of the table that has been changed/added
